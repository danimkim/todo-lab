# Todo Lab

## About

Todo Lab is a monorepo project designed for learning various programming languages and frameworks. Through repeatedly building the same todo list application with different languages and frameworks, I aim to internalize core concepts and better understand the unique characteristics of each technology stack.

## Purpose

- **Learning by Doing**: Master core concepts of each technology by repeatedly implementing a simple todo app
- **Technology Comparison**: Understand the unique features of each technology by implementing the same functionality in different ways
- **Hands-on Practice**: Get comfortable with the syntax and development workflow of each framework

## Project Structure

```

├── vanilla-js/         # Pure JavaScript implementation
├── react/              # React (planned)
├── vue/                # Vue.js (planned)

├── node-express/       # Node.js + Express backend (planned)
└── ...                 # More to come
```

## Common Features

All todo list implementations include the following basic features:

- Add new todo
- Edit todo
- Delete todo
- Toggle completion status
- View all todos
- Filter todos (All/Completed/Active)

## Getting Started

Each folder is an independent project. Refer to the README in each folder for specific instructions.

## Feedback

Your feedback is always welcome! Whether it's suggestions for improvements, best practices, or better implementation patterns, feel free to share your thoughts. If you'd like to provide feedback, please open an issue in this repository. This is a learning project, and I'm always looking to improve and learn from others.
